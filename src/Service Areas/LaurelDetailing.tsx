                        <p>
                            Mobile detailing is significantly more comprehensive than a car wash. We provide a meticulous cleaning, polishing, and protection process for both the interior and exterior of your car, unlike a car wash that focuses primarily on a quick exterior clean.

                        <p>
                            The frequency depends on your driving habits and how well you maintain your car. Generally, a professional detail every 6-12 months is recommended in Laurel, MD to maintain a fresh look and protect your car's finish.
